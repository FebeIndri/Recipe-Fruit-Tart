    <h3>To make Pastry Cream</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium non-aluminum saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until tiny bubbles appear on the surface, about 6 to 8 minutes (180 degrees). Stir to prevent scalding.</li>

        <li>Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens to a firm consistency, about 5 to 8 minutes. Whisk in vanilla and pour in to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on to the surface of the pastry cream. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 to 3 hours.</li>

    <h3>To blind-bake the Tart Crust</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a thickness of 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch. If the dough crumbles or breaks apart, press it back together with your fingertips.</li>

        <li>Loosely roll the dough around the rolling pin, then gently unroll it over the tart pan, preferably with a removable bottom (9 inches, or substitute a pie plate). Press the dough firmly into the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Trim any excess dough.</li>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Vanilla:</b> ½ vanilla bean, split, may be substituted for the vanilla extract in the pastry cream. </li>
        <li><b>Fruit:</b> Choose an assortment of different types, colors, and shapes. You could also decorate on a theme such as tropical (pineapple, kiwi, mango) or winter citrus (red grapefruit, blood orange, and clementine). </li>
        <li><b>Apricot jam:</b> Brushing some warmed apricot glaze over your fruit is like adding a shiny top coat. It keeps the fruit hydrated and looking its best. Apple jelly works too. Strawberry jelly tastes good but will tinge the fruit pink. </li>
        <li><b>Pie weights:</b> Used when blind-baking a crust so the crust stays flat. You can use store-bought pie weights or substitute dried beans (you cannot eat the beans after they’ve been baked). After baking, cool the beans completely and store them in a plastic bag for future baking projects. Yield: This recipe makes 1 (9-inch) tart with 8 slices. </li>
        <li><b>Storage:</b> Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
    </ul>
